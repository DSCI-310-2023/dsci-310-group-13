### Introduction

After being acquired by Google in 2006, Youtube obtained a rapid growth in popularity resulting in a growing community. In 2022, Youtube was the second most trafficked site in the world, only behind Google, sitting at 74.8 billion visited worldwide according to Statista. Some people may have wondered if they could persue Youtube as a potential career. As a result, researching about certain analytics would drive their videos to go "viral" as we know today. Youtube only displays a certain amount of data for the viewers on first glance. While certain features of Youtube have since been removed since 2007 to 2008, most notibly the rating feature, the dataset we have chosen still includes the information, and we will be utilizing it in our analysis. Below included is a screenshot of what an example Youtube webpage would look like in 2007.

**The goal of this project is to use the data of 2007 to predict the view of videos in 2008.**

We will be using datasets from https://netsg.cs.sfu.ca/youtubedata/. This website compiles data from 2007 to 2008 of all Youtube videos crawled on their website. The process of which is described in more detail on the actual website. The key categories parsed are video ID, uploader, **age**, category, **length**, **views**, **rate**, **rating**, **comment count** and related IDs, but only the points in **bold** will be explored in this analysis.

The two days we have chosen are May 5th, 2007 and May 4th, 2008. The reason for picking these two days is because these days are weekends, and both should represent a normal Youtube traffick day, i.e, it is not a day in which there is a holiday or otherwise that would significantly increase Youtube view count on those specific days.

**“Discovering the major sources that drive views to a video and understanding how they impact the view growth pattern have become interesting topics for researchers as well as advertisers, media companies, or anyone who wish to have a shortcut to stardom”. (Zhou et al., 2016)**


### Methods

```{r setup, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Setup
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(corrplot)
library(car)
library(leaps)
library(youtubeFunction)
```

We decide to immediately remove some of the variables presented in the datasets. This included `uploader`,`video ID`, and `related IDs` because these variables appear to be unique to the videos itself and not affect video views as a whole.

```{r load, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#load the cleaned datasets
data2007 = read.delim("/home/rstudio/data/data2007_cleaned.txt", 
                      sep = "\t", dec = ".", header = TRUE)
data2008 = read.delim("/home/rstudio/data/data2008_cleaned.txt", 
                      sep = "\t", dec = ".", header = TRUE)
head(data2007)
```

**Table 1:** The dataset obtained uses a crawler to obtained video API and scrape the webpage for the remaining information.
\
\

**Features: **
\
**-Age:** an integer number of days between the date when the video was uploaded and Feb.15, 2007

**-Category:** string of the video category chosen by the uploader

**-Length:** integer number of the video length

**-Views:** integer number of the views

**-Rate:** float number of the video rate

**-Ratings:** integer number of the ratings

**-Comments:** integer number of the comments
\
\

### Preliminary Analysis

```{r figureOne, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/rstudio/output/figure_1.png")
```

**Figure 1:** Plot of `views` against the quantitative explanatory variables

We can observe that most variables do not a have linear relationship with the predictor variable, only `ratings` has a slight positive linear relationship. Some variables like `length` and `comments` may benefit from a logarithmic transformation.

```{r figureTwo, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/rstudio/output/figure_2.png")
```

**Figure 2:** Plot of the number of views garnered by each type of category.
\
\

```{r figureThree, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/rstudio/output/figure_3.png")
```

**Figure 3:** Correlation plot of the predictor and the explanatory variables, excluding `category`

Taking a look at the correlation plot, we can see that `ratings` and `comments` have the strong positive relationship with the predictive variable `views`. Meanwhile, the other explanatory variables have a very weak relationship with `views`. `ratings` has a positive correlation with `view` and `comments` too. Because there are explanatory variables with correlation against each other, we check if multicollinearity is significant by taking a look at the VIF scores.

```{r vif, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
vif(lm(views~.,data2007))
```

**Table 2:** VIF values of the explanatory variables

The VIF values of the variables are not particularly big, so multicollinearity would not affect the model significantly. 
\
\

### Model Selection

```{r bestmethod, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Find the best model for each size
bestmod <- regsubsets(views~.,data2007,method='exhaustive')
summary(bestmod)
```
\
\
Looking at the selection algorithm, variables like `age`. `ratings`, and `comments` appear in most subsets. On the other hand, `category` did not appear consistently in the subsets, while `length` and `rate` were present in half of the displayed subsets.
\
\
```{r figureFour, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/home/rstudio/output/figure_4.png")
```

**Figure 4:** Plot of the adjusted $R^2$ and BIC values against the size of the models
\
\
A well-fitted model would have a high adjusted $R^2$ and low BIC values, but these metrics are not particularly prioritized because our end goal is prediction, so we rather prioritize reducing RMSE. However, this figure suggests a large model would fit well with the data.
\
\

### Analysis

We choose to use 2 explanatory variables: `age` and `ratings` to predict our response variable. While having a larger model would fit our data better, we hope that minimizing the number of explanatory variables will reduce RMSE.

```{r reduce, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Selecting variables for reduced model
datareduced <- data2007 |>  select(c(views,age,ratings,comments))
```

```{r fit, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Split data into training and testing set
split <- initial_split(datareduced, prop = 3/4, strata = views)
train <- training(split)
test <- testing(split)

# Fit the regression model
lm_fit <- fit_regression(train)
lm_fit
```
\
Although there is a low p-value for the coefficients, the adjusted R-squared value is not particularly high and an extremely high standard error.
\
\
```{r performance, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Lets look at how well our model performed
# code adapted from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awes# ome_table_in_html.html
lm_test_results <- read.csv("/home/rstudio/output/lm_test_results.csv")

kableExtra::kbl(lm_test_results, caption = "Metrics of the fitted model") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", 
                            full_width = F, position= "left")
```
\
It seems like the residual mean squared error is still enormously high, but the RMSE is smaller than that of the full model.
\
\
```{r predict, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# Lets see if our model can predict the 2008 values well
predict_vs_obs <- read.csv("/home/rstudio/output/predict_vs_obs.csv")


# code adapted from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awes# ome_table_in_html.html
kableExtra::kbl(predict_vs_obs, caption = "Table of predicted and observed values") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", 
                            full_width = F, position= "left")
```
\

### Discussion

Our predicted values are several times higher than the actual 2008 values.

There could be many reasons for why the predicted values are significantly higher. Youtube videos being uploaded earlier is not necessary for a video to be popular. We know now based on market research that the first 48 hours of a Youtube video being uploaded is the most important. If a video has 0 views, Youtube will stop displaying the video as it does not drive traffic towards their website. If a video can make it past the 48 hours with some amount of views, it is possible to see an increase in views over the span of 3 to 6 months (Clark, 2019). Meaning that if a video does not get any views, it will likely not get any views in the future either. This would slightly impact our data analysis as there are many more videos that do not get any views than videos that do get views. Making our error values much higher than what we had assumed.

Another reason our error values could be high is due to user influence. Youtube has gone through many phases, many genres of videos have been the top category on Youtube since its genesis. There is a possibility that during the period between 2007 and 2008, traffic on videos was not as high due to a lull in user interest in the videos. What a user likes to watch is constantly changing, so what is popular in 2007 might not be popular again in 2008, which results in the large gap between the actual values of the 2008 May views.

Furthermore, with its ever growing user base, some of the explanatory variables we have included in our model may not be as significant. For example, comments, the number of comments required to have an affect on video views could increase due to Youtube having a more saturated audience.

A way in which to improve our model would be removing certain outliers of the videos that get zero to ten views, but not the upper end of videos with millions of views. The reason we would get rid of the lower view count videos is because while this is a fairly large portion of our dataset, since these videos do not get any meaningful information out of them, removing them would be better for our model. We would keep the upper end of videos as theses videos would be a good reference point for many others who want to have a video get popular on Youtube, and represent what quantitative goals people should strive for when trying to make videos.

Another approach to improving the model is potentially adding in more variables. This would help the model fit better with the data, but the downside is the residual mean squared error would increase. Other than adding more variables, applying a transformation to some of the explanatory variables may have provided a more accurate model; however, the interpretability of the regression model would become more complicated.

### Future Questions

A future question this type of analysis would ultimately lead to would be something like "What is the number 1 influence over the number of views in a video?" The current trend on Youtube is for the Youtuber to say to "like" the video, which would impact the rating category, or to leave a comment, which would increase the comment count. But short videos tend to better than long videos, and songs do better than videos that are seconds long (Macmanus, R). So what's the best way to break out into the Youtube scene?

“From 2006 to 2009, most channels fall into the Music category, reaching a high in 2009 when more than 20% of all created channels would upload mainly Music videos. Entertainment, People & Blogs and Education were also continuously popular among creators during these years. However, from 2010 onwards, the majority of newly created channels were People & Blogs, coming close to 75% in 2016. Gaming started to be the second most channel category in 2012 and has remained in that place ever since.” (Bärtl, 2018)

### Conclusion

Using an exhaustive search for model selection, we were determined to use the variables age,comments, and ratings to predict the views of May 4th 2008. The model was trained on a set of training data before tested with a smaller set of testing data. We used this model to predict the views in 2008 and the predicted values were several times higher than the actual values. This was to be expected considering the ever-changing and growing Youtube, and so, we are hesitant to use this mode in a professional setting given the unreliable predictions.
